# Keras-paper-implementations

A curated list of implementations in keras.      

It's a bit of a hassle to find implementation of most of the latest papers. Hopefully this allows anyone to get up and running with the state-of-the-art networks in little to no time.    
    
**We welcome your contributions!**

If you have any paper/code suggestions, please feel free to edit and pull a request.
